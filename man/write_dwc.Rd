\section{Transformation details}{

Data are transformed into an
\href{https://rs.gbif.org/core/dwc_occurrence_2022-02-02.xml}{Occurrence core}.
This \strong{follows recommendations} discussed and created by Peter Desmet,
Jonas Mortelmans, Jonathan Pye, John Wieczorek and others.
See the \href{https://github.com/inbo/etn/tree/main/inst/sql}{SQL file(s)}
used by this function for details.

Key features of the Darwin Core transformation:
\itemize{
\item Deployments (animal+tag associations) are parent events, with capture,
surgery, release, recapture (human observations) and acoustic detections
(machine observations) as child events.
No information about the parent event is provided other than its ID,
meaning that data can be expressed in an Occurrence Core with one row per
observation and \code{parentEventID} shared by all occurrences in a deployment.
\item The release event often contains metadata about the animal (sex,
lifestage, comments) and deployment as a whole.
\item Acoustic detections are downsampled to the \strong{first detection per hour},
to reduce the size of high-frequency data.
Duplicate detections (same animal, tag and timestamp) are excluded.
It is possible for a deployment to contain no detections, e.g. if the
tag malfunctioned right after deployment.
