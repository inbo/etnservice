}
\arguments{
\item{credentials}{A list with the username and password to connect to the ETN database.}

\item{deployment_id}{Integer (vector). One or more deployment identifiers.}

\item{receiver_id}{Character (vector). One or more receiver identifiers.}

\item{acoustic_project_code}{Character (vector). One or more acoustic
project codes. Case-insensitive.}

\item{station_name}{Character (vector). One or more deployment station
names.}

\item{open_only}{Logical. Restrict deployments to those that are currently
open (i.e. no end date defined). Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A tibble with acoustic deployment data, sorted by
\code{acoustic_project_code}, \code{station_name} and \code{deploy_date_time}. See also

\description{
Get data for deployments of acoustic receivers, with options to filter
results.

\examples{
# Set credentials

   password = Sys.getenv("pwd")
 )

# Get all acoustic deployments
